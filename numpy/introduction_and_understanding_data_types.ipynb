    "# Introduction to NumPy\n",

    "Datasets can come from a wide range of sources and a wide range of formats, including be collections of documents, collections of images, collections of sound clips, collections of numerical measurements, or nearly anything else. Despite this apparent heterogeneity, it will help us to think of all data fundamentally as arrays of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, images–particularly digital images–can be thought of as simply two-dimensional arrays of numbers representing pixel brightness across the area. Sound clips can be thought of as one-dimensional arrays of intensity versus time. Text can be converted in various ways into numerical representations, perhaps binary digits representing the frequency of certain words or pairs of words. No matter what the data are, the first step in making it analyzable will be to transform them into arrays of numbers. For this reason, efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays is absolutely fundamental to the process of doing data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy (short for Numerical Python) provides an efficient interface to store and operate on dense data buffers. In some ways, NumPy arrays are like Python's built-in list type, but NumPy arrays provide much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size. NumPy arrays form the core of nearly the entire ecosystem of data science tools in Python, so time spent learning to use NumPy effectively will be valuable no matter what aspect of data science interests you."

    "# Understanding data types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective data-driven science and computation requires understanding how data is stored and manipulated. This section outlines and contrasts how arrays of data are handled in the Python language itself, and how NumPy improves on this. Understanding this difference is fundamental to understanding much of the material throughout the rest of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of Python are often drawn-in by its ease of use, one piece of which is dynamic typing. While a statically-typed language like C or Java requires each variable to be explicitly declared, a dynamically-typed language like Python skips this specification. This means, for example, that we can assign any kind of data to any variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of flexibility is one piece that makes Python and other dynamically-typed languages convenient and easy to use. Understanding how this works is an important piece of learning to analyze data efficiently and effectively with Python. But what this type-flexibility also points to is the fact that Python variables are more than just their value; they also contain extra information about the type of the value."

    "## A Python integer is more than just an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard Python implementation is written in C. This means that every Python object is simply a cleverly-disguised C structure, which contains not only its value, but other information as well. For example, when we define an integer in Python, such as `x = 10000`, `x` is not just a \"raw\" integer. It's actually a pointer to a compound C structure, which contains several values (Python 3.4):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ob_refcnt`, a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation\n",
    "- `ob_type`, which encodes the type of the variable\n",
    "- `ob_size`, which specifies the size of the following data members\n",
    "- `ob_digit`, which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that there is some overhead in storing an integer in Python as compared to an integer in a compiled language like C, as illustrated in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![cint](images/cint_vs_pyint.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `PyObject_HEAD` is the part of the structure containing the reference count, type code, and other pieces mentioned before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the difference here: a C integer is essentially a label for a position in memory whose bytes encode an integer value. A Python integer is a pointer to a position in memory containing all the Python object information, including the bytes that contain the integer value. This extra information in the Python integer structure is what allows Python to be coded so freely and dynamically. All this additional information in Python types comes at a cost, however, which becomes especially apparent in structures that combine many of these objects."
